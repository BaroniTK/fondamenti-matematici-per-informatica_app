# FondamentiApp Guide

## Activity 1: Solving a system of congruences

1. **Opening the application**: Start the application and select the first activity.
2. **Data entry**: Enter the coefficients and modules of the congruence system to solve.
3. **Solving**: Press the button to solve the system.
4. **Results**: View the solutions of the congruence system.

## Activity 2: Calculation of maximum and minimum in the RSA method

1. **Activity selection**: Switch to the second activity.
2. **RSA data entry**: Enter the values needed for the calculation (probably modulo n and public or private exponent).
3. **Calculation**: Start the calculation to find the maximum and minimum for the RSA method.
4. **Results display**: Displays the calculated maximum and minimum values.

## Activity 3: Euclid's Algorithm and MCD calculation

1. **Access to the third activity**: Skip to the third activity.
2. **Calculation of Euclid's algorithm with "backward" substitution**:
    1. Select the option to run Euclid's algorithm with "backward" substitution.
    2. Enter the two numbers for calculation.
    3. Display the result.
3. **Calculation of MCD with prime factor decomposition**:
    1. Select the option to calculate MCD with prime factor decomposition.
    2. Enter the two numbers for calculation.
    3. View the result.

## Activity 4: Verification of isomorphism between graphs

1. **Access to fourth activity**: Skip to the fourth activity.
2. **Data entry**: Enter all links for n graphs chosen by the user.
3. **Isomorphism check**:
    1. The application checks whether the graphs are isomorphic to each other by using the 6 obstructions and looking for a bigection between the graphs.
4. **Results**: Displays which graphs are isomorphic to each other and which are not.

## Activity 5: Checking the score of a graph

1. **Access to fifth activity**: Go to the fifth activity.
2. **Data entry**: Enter the two vectors to be verified.
3. **Score verification**:
    1. The application verifies which of the vectors is the score of a graph by checking the 4 obstructions and applying the score theorem.
    2. The application creates the graph corresponding to the valid vector.
4. **Application and visualization**:
    1. The application answers a series of questions about the created graph, such as:
        1. Is there a tree with such a score?
        2. Is the graph Hamiltonian?
        3. Is the graph disconnected or connected?
        4. Is the graph 2-connected?
        5. Are there n connected components?

## General Notes

1. **Correct Input**: Be sure to enter the data correctly according to the requirements of each activity.
2. **Output**: Results will be displayed after calculation or resolution.
3. **Repetition**: You can repeat the process as many times as you wish, switching between activities as needed.
